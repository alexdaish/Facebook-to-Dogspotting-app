## Also
- This was all inspired by [Millenials to Snake People](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/millennials-to-snake-peop/jhkibealmjkbkafogihpeidfcgnigmlf) which itself was inspired by [Cloud to Butt Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud-to-butt-plus/apmlngnhgbnjpajelfkmabhkfapgnoai?hl=en)

## Thanks
This is all code highly borrowed ie. stolen from [Eric Bailey](https://github.com/ericwbailey/millennials-to-snake-people)
